# Player Performance Analysis

This project analyzes football player statistics by identifying similar players based on key attributes such as `finishing`, `dribbling`, and `acceleration`. The analysis involves data preprocessing, feature scaling, and clustering using **cosine similarity** to compare players' skill sets. The project also visualizes the distribution of player skills through various charts.

## Key Features:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and scaled player stats for accurate analysis.
- **Similarity Analysis**: Used **cosine similarity** to find players with similar attributes.
- **Data Visualization**: Created **histograms**, **boxplots**, and bar charts to visualize skill distributions and player comparisons.

## Tools & Technologies:
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**

## How to Run:
